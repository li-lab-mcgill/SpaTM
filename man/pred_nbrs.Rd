\title{Predict Neighbor Relationships Using Theta Matrix and Weights}
\usage{
pred_nbrs(theta, weights, max_val = 1, loss_fun = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{theta}{The inferred cell/spot-topic mixtures}

\item{weights}{RTM-derived weights. With the intercept as the first value}

\item{max_val}{A numeric scalar used for normalization in loss function 0.
Default is 1.}

\item{loss_fun}{An integer specifying the loss function to use:
\itemize{
  \item 0: Exponential with normalization: exp(x*weights) / max_val
  \item 1: Logistic/sigmoid: 1 / (1 + exp(-x*weights))
  \item 2: Linear: x*weights
}
Default is 1.}
}
\value{
Predicted adjacency matrix representing all neighbor predictions
}
\description{
This function is a wrapper around the Rcpp function `nbr_pred` that computes
pairwise predictions between all rows in a theta matrix using specified weights
and loss function.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create example theta matrix
theta <- matrix(runif(12), nrow = 3, ncol = 4)

# Create weights (5 weights: 4 for features + 1 for bias)
weights <- c(0.1, 0.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.2)

# Use exponential loss function
pred_exp <- pred_nbrs(theta, weights, max_val = 10, loss_fun = 0)

# Use logistic loss function
pred_logistic <- pred_nbrs(theta, weights, loss_fun = 1)

# Use linear loss function
pred_linear <- pred_nbrs(theta, weights, loss_fun = 2)
}
